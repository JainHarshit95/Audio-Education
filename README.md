'Learning happens when we take an interest in the subject and here at nooblerr, we make create interest in topics through our gamification and storytelling'

The application combines education and gaming with the help of storytelling. The main aim of this app is to create an ecosystem where user can learn different subjects with the help of Gaming and Audio-based Virtual reality storytelling. The main aim of our app is to create an interest in different topics such as Mathematics, Social science and Science.  The app is the initial step towards the full-fledged version of gamified education. The App will host a variety of games which are based on textbooks topics. These games(paid and Free) can be downloaded through our app. Every major topic can be understood using our games and sound-based virtual reality stories.
In its full fledge form, we will create a platform where users can upload their story-based audio files for different subject and topics and the user can access them.

This is link to our Pre beta version of our app which is an hybrid of Ed Tech and Gaming app together. 

As it is pre beta version so it consist of many some bugs. 
At last you will see thank you image before completion of story line. Kindly hang on till the music stopped fully. We will sort out this issue soon. Thanks for your patience. Enjoy


It's sound based game only. It is divided into three parts. 
1. Sound story
2. Game play(sound based and it will improve greatly in upcoming version) 
3. Education part video. 

So kindly keep an eye on screen as sometime it will be blank, sometime it will hage video and sometime it have controllers. 

Sorry for any confusion in advance.
